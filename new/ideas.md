# Some ideas

* start with one free demonling as lee
* earn enough manual laffs to afford another critter
* learn about assigning lees and lers
* learn about auto actions
  * tickle until:
    * fainting
    * almost fainting
    * custom stamina threshold
    * custom endurance threshold
  * resume tickling once:
    * stamina fully recovered
    * custom stamina threshold
    * endurance fully recovered
    * custom endurance threshold
* find about building constraints and how initially tickling rooms can only have 1 ticklee who, in turn, can only have 1 tickler assigned to them
* there are options now
  * buy another tickling room (cheap)
  * increase tickling room level (less cheap)
* once "x" demonlings recruited, their housing is introduced
  * in demonlings case, it's a portal
* portal needs to be built first
* once built it supports more demonlings up to a limit
* it can also be upgraded
  * in level, allowing demonlings to be upgraded in level (expensive)
    * in size, allowing more demonlings to be recruited (less expensive)
* demonlings can be upgraded now too
* once "y' demonlings recruited, a free fufflebug joins
* fufflebugs can be hired now too
* they have better stats but can get fatigued over time
  * fatigued workers have a penalty to stats
* auto action
  * rest when:
    * never
    * fatigued
      * custom fatigue threshold
    * rest type:
      * nap
      * lazy work
    * rest until:
      * fully rested
      * custom fatigue threshold
* once "z" fufflebugs recruited, their housing is introduced
* need to build their nest first for more fufflebugs
* can also be upgraded in level and size
* fufflebugs can be upgraded now too
* once "a" fufflebugs recruited, a free bundelion joins
* bundelions can be hired now too for food and laffs
* they have better stats but can get hungry and fatigued
  * hungry workers have a penalty to stats
  * hungry stacks with fatigued
* farms are unlocked
* they can produce food but require workers to do so
* they can be upgraded in size (more workers = more production) and level (better stats)
* auto action:
  * eat when:
    * never
    * hungry
    * custom hunger threshold
  * eat until:
    * sated
    * custom hunger threshold
* once "b" bundelions are recruited, their housing is introduced
* need to build their nest to be able to hire more of them
* it can be upgraded in size and level
* bundelions can be upgraded in level
* once "c" bundelions are recruited, a free n'voii joins
* can hire n'voii now
* n'voii don't need to eat or sleep
