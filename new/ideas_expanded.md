# Expanded ideas

* Different starting point: blancs, based on Azelgard's servants (cardworld)
* Generic and with lowest starting stats
  * Not even sure if upgradeable
  * Relatively cheap cost and no maintenance

* Other species need to be unlocked via buildings

# Existing species

* Demonlings need their portal
* Fufflebugs need their nest
* Bundelions need their burrow
* N'voii need their obelisk
* Stonautos need their ruins
